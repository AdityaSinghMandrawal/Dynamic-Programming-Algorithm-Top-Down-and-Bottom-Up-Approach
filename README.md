# Dynamic Programming Algorithms using both top-down (recursive with memoization) and bottom-up (iterative with tabulation) approaches in C++

This repository contains C++ implementations of several fundamental dynamic programming (DP) algorithms using both top-down (recursive with memoization) and bottom-up (iterative with tabulation) approaches. Each algorithm includes detailed code examples and explanations to help you understand and apply these techniques.

## Algorithms Included

### 1. Fibonacci Sequence
- **Top-Down Approach**: Recursive solution with memoization.
- **Bottom-Up Approach**: Iterative solution with tabulation.

### 2. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
- **Top-Down Approach**: Recursive solution with memoization.
- **Bottom-Up Approach**: Iterative solution with tabulation.

### 3. 0/1 Knapsack Problem
- **Top-Down Approach**: Recursive solution with memoization.
- **Bottom-Up Approach**: Iterative solution with tabulation.

### 4. Matrix Chain Multiplication
- **Top-Down Approach**: Recursive solution with memoization.
- **Bottom-Up Approach**: Iterative solution with tabulation.

### 5. Min Cost Climbing Stairs
- **Top-Down Approach**: Recursive solution with memoization.
- **Bottom-Up Approach**: Iterative solution with tabulation.

### 6. Coin Change Problem
- **Top-Down Approach**: Recursive solution with memoization.
- **Bottom-Up Approach**: Iterative solution with tabulation.

## Advantages of Each Approach

### Top-Down Approach (Recursive with Memoization)
1. **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and understand due to its recursive nature.
2. **Optimal Substructure**: Naturally handles overlapping subproblems by storing already computed results.
3. **Readability**: Often more intuitive and easier to read and debug.

### Bottom-Up Approach (Iterative with Tabulation)
1. **Efficiency**: Generally more efficient in terms of time complexity as it avoids the overhead of recursive function calls.
2. **Space Complexity**: Can be more space-efficient as it only stores necessary data rather than keeping a call stack.
3. **Iterative Nature**: Can handle larger input sizes without the risk of stack overflow that may occur with deep recursion.
