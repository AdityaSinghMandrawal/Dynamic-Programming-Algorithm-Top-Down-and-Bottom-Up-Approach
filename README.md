# Dynamic Programming Algorithms using both top-down (recursive with memoization) and bottom-up (iterative with tabulation) approaches in C++

This repository contains C++ implementations of several fundamental dynamic programming (DP) algorithms using both top-down (recursive with memoization) and bottom-up (iterative with tabulation) approaches. Each algorithm includes detailed code examples and explanations to help you understand and apply these techniques.

## Algorithms Included

- **Bottom-Up Approach**: [Iterative solution with tabulation](https://github.com/AdityaSinghMandrawal/Dynamic-Programming-Algorithm-Top-Down-and-Bottom-Up-Approach/blob/main/Fibonacci_Sequence.cpp).

### 2. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
- **Top-Down Approach**: [Recursive solution with memoization](https://github.com/AdityaSinghMandrawal/Dynamic-Programming-Algorithm-Top-Down-and-Bottom-Up-Approach/blob/main/Longest_Common_Subsequence.cpp).
- **Bottom-Up Approach**: [Iterative solution with tabulation](https://github.com/AdityaSinghMandrawal/Dynamic-Programming-Algorithm-Top-Down-and-Bottom-Up-Approach/blob/main/Longest_Common_Subsequence.cpp).

### 3. 0/1 Knapsack Problem
- **Top-Down Approach**: [Recursive solution with memoization](https://github.com/AdityaSinghMandrawal/Dynamic-Programming-Algorithm-Top-Down-and-Bottom-Up-Approach/blob/main/01_Knapsack.cpp).
- **Bottom-Up Approach**: [Iterative solution with tabulation](https://github.com/AdityaSinghMandrawal/Dynamic-Programming-Algorithm-Top-Down-and-Bottom-Up-Approach/blob/main/01_Knapsack.cpp).

### 4. Matrix Chain Multiplication
- **Top-Down Approach**: [Recursive solution with memoization](https://github.com/AdityaSinghMandrawal/Dynamic-Programming-Algorithm-Top-Down-and-Bottom-Up-Approach/blob/main/Matrix_chain_Multiplication.cpp).
- **Bottom-Up Approach**: [Iterative solution with tabulation](https://github.com/AdityaSinghMandrawal/Dynamic-Programming-Algorithm-Top-Down-and-Bottom-Up-Approach/blob/main/Matrix_chain_Multiplication.cpp).

### 5. Min Cost Climbing Stairs
- **Top-Down Approach**: [Recursive solution with memoization](https://github.com/AdityaSinghMandrawal/Dynamic-Programming-Algorithm-Top-Down-and-Bottom-Up-Approach/blob/main/Min_Cost_Climbing_Stairs.cpp).
- **Bottom-Up Approach**: [Iterative solution with tabulation](https://github.com/AdityaSinghMandrawal/Dynamic-Programming-Algorithm-Top-Down-and-Bottom-Up-Approach/blob/main/Min_Cost_Climbing_Stairs.cpp).

### 6. Coin Change Problem
- **Top-Down Approach**: [Recursive solution with memoization](https://github.com/AdityaSinghMandrawal/Dynamic-Programming-Algorithm-Top-Down-and-Bottom-Up-Approach/blob/main/Coin_Change.cpp).
- **Bottom-Up Approach**: [Iterative solution with tabulation](https://github.com/AdityaSinghMandrawal/Dynamic-Programming-Algorithm-Top-Down-and-Bottom-Up-Approach/blob/main/Coin_Change.cpp).

## Advantages of Each Approach

### Top-Down Approach (Recursive with Memoization)
1. **Simplicity**: Easy to implement and understand due to its recursive nature.
2. **Optimal Substructure**: Naturally handles overlapping subproblems by storing already computed results.
3. **Readability**: Often more intuitive and easier to read and debug.

### Bottom-Up Approach (Iterative with Tabulation)
1. **Efficiency**: Generally more efficient in terms of time complexity as it avoids the overhead of recursive function calls.
2. **Space Complexity**: Can be more space-efficient as it only stores necessary data rather than keeping a call stack.
3. **Iterative Nature**: Can handle larger input sizes without the risk of stack overflow that may occur with deep recursion.
